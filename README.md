# Popcorn Website

## This is a single-page website built with React as a SPA using several libraries.

### For managing remote state, the `react-query` library has been utilized. It also features `pre-fetching` capabilities, which enhance user experience by caching data for previous and next pages before they are loaded (`pagination`).

### Routing is handled by the `react-router-dom` library.

### `styled-components` have been used for styling the components, taking advantage of some of its attractive features, such as using parameters in CSS based on relevant conditions.

### All data is retrieved and processed from an `API` created by `TMDB`.

### A search feature has been added to allow users to find movies by title by entering the name in the search section, with results displayed in `real-time`.

### To provide a more pleasant user experience, the movie display cards are designed to be flip cards, showing the movie information, vote count, and rating, complemented by animations for the cards.

### The page design is `fully responsive`.

## `Note`

- All variable types have been checked using the `prop-types` library to ensure type safety in JavaScript.
